Hi, my name is Jay Khandkar and I am interested in various low level aspects of
software such as firmware (mostly hardware init), operating systems, and even
a bit of hardware - mostly simple RTL designs in Verilog and VHDL.

Here you'll find some articles about my findings when diving deep into some 
obscure aspects of x86 systems.
